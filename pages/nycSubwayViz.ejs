  <h2>How close are NYC subway entrances to stations?</h2>
</div>
<div class="project_brief">
  Supposedly New York City has one of the most complex and difficult to navigate
  subway systems, where walking into a wrong station entrance is a common
  occurence, with the right one being rather far away. I wondered how accurate
  this statement is and thus set out to visualise the subway stations and their
  entrances as a personal project. Throughout making the visualisation I learned
  Mapbox GL JS.
