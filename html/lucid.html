        A design for an app that helps users to maintain and achieve a regular and healthy sleeping pattern by providing them tips and suggestions in combination with customizable alarm and lullaby sounds. Developed throughout one of my university modules in a team of four through the use of agile and other design processes.

          <h5>THE ISSUE</h5>
          <p>Many university students struggle with sleep deprivation or bad quality sleep due to their busy schedule, requiring them to balance fast approaching coursework deadlines, everyday chores and social interactions. Having a regular sleeping pattern therefore proves to be a difficulty, yet it is vital to stay healthy and perform well especially during exam season. Moreover, due to the constantly connected culture we live in, people find it hard to put down their phones and often struggle with insomnia. Consequently, our group decided to tackle this problem by designing an app that would help the users stay on track with their habits while providing them personalised suggestions with other features such as alarms and sounds to play while falling asleep.</p>

          <h5>IDEATION STAGE</h5>
          <p>The first step in our ideation process was brainstorming about factors playing the biggest role in lack of sleep and how we could ease them. The possible features the app could have consisted of choosing from various alarm sounds, setting the desired wake up time and ours of sleep, from which the user would be given a bedtime and being able to block any unwanted notifications/apps about half an hour before bedtime, which would help the user to fall asleep faster, as proven by studies showing that using a mobile phone right before sleeping affects the time needed to fall asleep.</p>

          <p>We also played with the idea of having rewards and inscentives depending on how successful the user would be with keeping up with the regular sleeping habit. As it is usually easier to detect progress when represented in a visual form, we considered implementing a garden that would grow every time the user good a good night's sleep, further motivating them to keep up. Alongside we would represent the data and progress on a weekly or monthly basis in a graph or chart.</p>

          <p>Lastly, we considered the idea of  a forum, where users could share their sleeping struggles and give/recieve advice from others with similar issues. A similar functionality could be achieved by having a a tips page where links to articles with recommendations for getting a better quality sleep, relaxing more effectivly, or new research would be gathered.</p>

          <h5>GUERILLA USABILITY TESTING</h5>
          <p>To measure the usability of the initial idea for our app – the features as well as a brief design, and evaluate how appropriate and efficient it is, we placed our low fidelity paper prototypes in front of several potential users and observed how they interacted with them.</p>

          <p>The tasks were to be tested chosen, during which one member of our group observed the test subjects and gave then necessary instructions, one video-recorded the process, one measured the task completion time and one dealt with prototypes – moving them to show the interaction between the apps features. Prior to giving instructions to test subjects we gave a brief introduction to our app, outlining some of the features, without explaining how to use or locate them in order to see how a potential user would interact with the app and interpret it for themselves in real life. To get better insight and understanding of our testing we asked the test subjects further questions right after they completed all task in a post-observation interview.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
        <p>After gathering all data and analysing it we came to the following conclusions regarding the features and the design of our prototypes. The overall app was regarded as aesthetically pleasing (multiple users stated that they specifically liked the “alarm” page). However, many pointed out that the icons on in navigation bar confused them – the tick does not logically imply “tips,” thus many could not find them on the first try. Moreover, there needs to be a clearer distinction between choosing sleeping and alarm sounds, and a clear way to select and confirm a specific sound, since some did not know whether they were choosing a sound to fall asleep or wake up to. On the other hand, the representation of the sounds’ categories in a form of circle icons seemed to be efficient and well-accepted. The tips for better sleep turned out to be the main advantage and what differentiated our app from others, however, some test subjects suggested that making them personalised would benefit the user more. Adding an incentive (e.g. a scoring system or a form of a game) in further versions of the app would make it more appealing, too, since it would prompt the users to use it more frequently and effectively. Lastly, adding more settings or simply the possibility of easily seeing what sounds were set as alarms or sleep sounds, turned out to be a beneficial improvement.</p>

          <h5>PROTOTYPE EVALUATION</h5>
          <p>To evaluate our prototypes we mainly used the cognitive walkthrough technique for each of the pages of both versions of the app. The following is a brief summary of the conclusions drawn from the evaluation.</p>
          <h6 style="margin: 0px; padding:0; font-size: 0.8rem; font-weight: normal; color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6); letter-spacing: 1.8px;">PROTOTYPE EVALUATION VERSION 1</h6>
          <p>The navigation is clearer navigation than in comparison to the first wireframe in user testing and the whole app pretty easy to navigate from one page to another – it’s clear what each page does.</p>
          <p>Improvements in regard to details: more pop ups showing the system status could be added (when an account is created or the profile page has been updated), a sharing pop for the articles should be implemented, too. Furthermore, ‘error’ messages in a case if an article was already saved and the user tried to save it again could be added. However, some pop-up messages have been implemented such as ‘saved to tips’ and ‘alarm set for _’, which do give the user more information. Similarly, providing information about the recommended hours of sleep right on the page where the user chooses them is a thoughtful addition.</p>
          <p>Although the whole app seems fairly clean and simple, some pages encounter a difficulty of being too cluttered such as the page for creating a new account and further customization of the profile, however in this case a lot has to do with technical issues with using Adobe XD. Nevertheless, the process of creating a new account is fairly consistent and follows the patter of general account creation used by other applications.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
          <h6 style="margin: 0px; padding:0; font-size: 0.8rem; font-weight: normal; color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6); letter-spacing: 1.8px;">PROTOTYPE EVALUATION VERSION 2</h6>

          <p>For the second prototype we used a different approach in the interaction and design for some of the app’s pages and features. We also build on the first version to give the user a better and more thought out experience. We implemented more error messages and other pop-ups showing the status of the system, although some more could still be added. Moreover, in this version it on one hand does seem more tedious when editing profile information or creating a new account, because the user must go through all of the options from beginning to the end and cannot simply alter just the one piece of information they want. On the other hand, it seems less cluttered that way, which was the issue with the previous version.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we find that it’s a useful feature that user is given personalised tips right on the profile page as this contributes to tackling the problem which our app tries to solve. Settings page was also evidently improved giving the user more options to choose from and having more control of the app. Some more interaction with the progress page could be implemented, however as this page is more visually as opposed to text based it makes it easier to read and understand all of the gathered data.</p>
          <h6 style="margin: 0px; padding:0; font-size: 0.8rem; font-weight: normal; color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6); letter-spacing: 1.8px;">OVERALL CONCLUSION</h6>
          <p>What we’ve learned from all of the evaluation was that making two different prototypes helped us to take a different approach to the overall design and use of our app. We have not decided that one would simply be better as the other, however we did see what works and what doesn’t, which lead us to the conclusion that producing a version incorporating both would bring us the furthest to solving our initial problem and helping the users.</p>
