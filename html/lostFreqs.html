  <div class="brief">
    <p>
      Lost Frequencies is an interactive web-based program representing a
      speculative reality. Contrived as an explorative game, it’s focus is on
      the concept, narration and user experience. Upon starting the game, the
      player enters a world stripped of language where the main form of
      communication are light and sounds emerging from interaction between the
      characters’ auras. These are assigned to people as they are born in the
      world, meaning each person is characterised by the colour of their aura
      and the sound accompanying it, both of which are clearly visible to the
      individual and everyone around them. Consequently, the world becomes
      rather “transparent,” since people’s true intentions are perceived from
      the onset, leading to less miscommunication in comparison toour reality.
      Therefore, the project’s purpose is to get the user to question how they
      communicate with others in the real world, as it is usually affected by
      superficial factors (gender, race, sexuality, etc.).
