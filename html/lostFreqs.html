        An 2D platformer browser based game made in JavaScript with p5.js.

      <div class="brief">
        <p>Lost  Frequencies  is  an  interactive  web-based  program  representing  a  speculative reality. 
          Contrived as an explorative game, it’s focus is on the concept, narration and user experience.  
          Upon  starting  the  game,  the  player  enters  a  world  stripped  of  language where the main form of communication are light and sounds emerging from interaction between  the  characters’  auras.  
          These  are  assigned  to  people  as  they  are  born  in  the world, meaning each person is characterised by the colour of their aura and the sound accompanying it, both of which are clearly visible to the individual and everyone around them. 
          Consequently, the world becomes rather “transparent,” since people’s true intentions are perceived from the onset, leading to less miscommunication in comparison toour reality. 
          Therefore, the project’s purpose is to get the user to question how  they  communicate  with  others  in  the  real  world,  as  it  is  usually  affected  by superficial factors (gender, race, sexuality, etc.).</p>
