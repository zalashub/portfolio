    <h1>What I learned at my research internship</h1>
</div>
<div class="blog_brief">
    <h4>Before my second year at university, I spent nearly 3 months at an internship at a research institute. These are my impressions and takeaways.</h4>
</div>

<div class="textContent">
    <p>Whilst the covid-19 pandemic forced most of us to adapt to a new reality, nearly stopping the fast-paced course of our lives in the spring, I’ve taken it upon myself to use this opportunity to gain new experiences. 
    After finishing my projects and exams for first year, getting a bit of a rest (whilst persistently developing my skills with numerous Coursera online courses and working on personal projects), 
    I’ve decided to dive into the field of research. Developer and other technology internships are usually commercial and conducted inside large companies, but I was curious to see what the research side of the field looked like. 
    I contacted the head of the computing department at Jožef Stefan Institute - the largest research institute in Slovenia - and pretty soon I was moving to the capital city to embark on what would be a challenging yet rewarding journey.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>The Before</h2>
    <p>Even before starting my first day, I wanted to explore and get the feel of the tools I’ve been told were used on the project I have been assigned to. (I like feeling prepared and utilising all my resources for a task). 
        Thus, I spent a good weekend learning all about (well, what I could in that time span) Angular, Leaflet and Git. I was to work on an international project providing actionable models for intelligent management of urban mobility, 
        my task being developing a working prototype of a data-driven interactive visualisation from AI simulation traffic data.
        <br><br>
        Monday arrived and so did my first assignments. After going through what has been done with my mentor, I began looking at ways to import and handle an XML file most efficiently, extracting data in a format that could then be used to visualise it 
        – the actual visualisation came a bit later. 
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>The Secrets</h2>
    <p>Despite being a novice at a research environment and with the particular technology we were using, I was quickly thrown into the loop of and was  finding myself being completely engrossed in the work. However, at that point, I was still unsure 
        who the project actually was for and how  all of the individual parts that each team member was working on will have come together. I was not getting the big picture – what our project was actually trying to achieve. Although at the time this wasn’t a big setback, me being generally interested in the project that will consume most of my time for the next couple of months, I wanted to know.
        <br><br>
        The ‘secrets’ were revealed soon after – at the first project meeting I attended. From what I’ve heard people find them tedious, yet it proved to be informative and enlightening for me by clearing some things up and setting us on a clearer path. 
        It allowed for us to reflect on the achieved and what still lay ahead of us, giving us a good way to prepare.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>Independent cooperation</h2>
    <p>One of the things that struck me throughout my internship is how independently yet collaboratively we worked. While most tasks were executed individually, it was required that we be in sync even on elementary tasks like making sure that the output 
        simulation file one person generated was compatible with the framework and setup that the other person (me) used to analyse the data and visualise it. Simultaneously, this particular way of working gave me the freedom to explore many ways of delivering what was asked of me, 
        spending a whole lot of hours on forums, stackoverflow, etc., looking at possibilities to implement a functionality or to solve a bug (just the usual programming things).
        <br><br>
        Of course it was not only smooth sailing from there. 
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>I was confronted by things I wouldn’t have expected - writing scientific reports that then turned into proper scientific papers, throughout the course of which I’ve found myself researching and reading other extensive articles and research papers on the topic. 
        Since the international project was nearly the first of its kind, there were not many resources that would give the exact desired results, thus I had to be resourceful, finding data and theory spanning across many sites. From looking at visualisation techniques, 
        I’ve learned a lot about advanced visualisation methods, specifically meant for traffic and traffic related data (list the use cases).
        <br><br>
        The hardest thing to grapple with however, was the continuous flow of seemingly unrelated and distinct tasks. Right when you figure something out, a new, completely different task is assigned. 
        "Start with loading in data, then visualise it, write the API and the input payload, dockerize the application, write a report, clean the data, research advanced techniques and write a paper." 
        Thankfully, I am used to working on various projects at once, and have accustomed to the process relatively quickly. This also prevented the work seeming tedious or repetitive.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>The Reward</h2>
    <p>Where there is effort, there are gains. Knowing the internship would be a learning experience in general, the extent to which it proved to be beneficial for my personal interests and university work was still surprising. 
        I could not only use the general competences or workflow-related technologies like git and the command line, but rather the specific skills like Node.js, Latex, working with XML files and the theory behind those, too. 
        <br><br>
        Moreover, despite the institute being a highly praised intellectual institution, working there did not seem as pressured as perhaps expected, a comforting fact as this was my first internship.  All in all,
        the internship experience was highly enriching and I'm incredibly grateful to be given the opportunity. The next question standing in line is: what will be my pursuit coming up?
