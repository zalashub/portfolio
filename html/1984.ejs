    <h5>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h5>
    <p>
      The project presents what would be the Party's website if the web existed
      in the novel's time. Aligning with other typical political websites (which
      I've studied prior to designing mine), this website advertises the Party
      as a political candidate, presenting it's manifesto, members, history,
      political goals, while encouraging the audience to vote, support or join
      in.
    </p>

  <div class="content">
    <h5>INSPIRATION</h5>
    <p>
      The design and structure of the site were inspired by other real political
      websites such as UK's Conservative party and the Labour Party. Moreover, I
      briefly researched the theory behind political parties by reading a study
      The Role of a Political Party Website: Lessons Learnt from the User
      Perspective.

    <h5>AUDIENCE, STAKEHOLDERS AND OBJECTIVE</h5>
    <p>
      The website is meant mainly to provide entertainment to readers of 1984
      and others, interested in modern day politics and dystopian literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may also serve as a means to compare the totalitarian regime of Ingsoc
      and the mindset of some real political parties nowadays. Thus, it at the
      same time highlights the dangers of such mentality if taken to an extreme,
      similarly as was the case with Orwell's objective with the novel,
      provoking debates about such regimes.

    <h5>ACCESSIBILITY AND USABILITY</h5>
    <p>
      I considered the usability of my website, making it responsive, keeping
      the layout clear and consistent, etc. To ensure accessibility I
      implemented and abode by most common Web accessibility standards.
