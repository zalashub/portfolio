  <h2>LGBT Data Visualisation</h2>
</div>
<div class="project_brief">
  The following is the first project I made using D3.js and a brief story of
  what I learned on the road to making it.
</div>

<div class="main_cont">

  <div class="textContent">
    After learning about data visualisation, seeing how powerful D3 is and the
    impeccable graphics that can be done with it, I've felt compelled to learn
    it right away. But I didn't want to make just a simple chart with random
    data and no particular meaning to me - I wanted to make a visualisation
    about an issue I'm passionate about. It just so happens that June (I was
    starting to learn D3 in May) is Pride Month, which was a perfect opportunity
    to make a LGBTQIA+ themed visualisation.
    <br /><br />
    In the project I wanted to highlight the developments regarding the
    acceptance of the LGBTQIA+ community and the pitfalls, too. The recent
    increasing negative attitude towards the community is worrying, especially
    in countries that seemed to show progress in the recent years. I wanted to
    explore and compare the different countries' stances on the issue.
    <br /><br />
    It took me a while to find the right dataset, eventually settling on
    Williams Institute of UCLA School of Law's report on Social Acceptance of
    LGBT People in 174 Countries, which upon analysing survey data produced the
    Global Acceptance Index - a measure of the relative level of social
    acceptance of LGBT people and rights in each country. Prior to my project, I
    didn't have any experience with data scraping, wrangling or any detailed
    data analysis, so I wasn't particularly happy to find the data available
    solely in tables in PDF appendices. But nevertheless, I've manually copied
    all the data to an Excel spreadsheet and turned it into a CSV file. Looking
    back now, there is definitely a faster and easier way to achieve that, but
    back then learning all different ways of handling data would have only
    slowed me down and I wanted to go straight down to business - making the
    actual visualisation.
    <br /><br />
    I could have gone with a simple bar or line chart, but as expected for me, I
    had a different vision, which turned out to require much more customisation
    of the functions available in D3. I set out to make a version of a circular
    bar chart or better - a circular lollipop chart. After playing around with
    the donut chart, arcs, band and radial scales, a repeating problem emerged.
    I wanted to group the countries by continent and display those around the
    circle, since having the option to compare specific continents by their
    Acceptance Indices seems to offer important and interesting insight into
    LGBTQIA+ acceptance. After playing around a bit more, which actually
    involved some data wrangling with D3, looking around multiple forums and
    with much trial and error, the chart looked like I envisioned it. The last
    step was adding colour - as per the pride theme, the colour choice was
    obvious. Here is the final result.
