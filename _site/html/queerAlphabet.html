  <h2>Queer Alphabet</h2>
</div>
<div class="project_brief">
  The publication aims to educate the broader public about LGBTQIA+ terminology,
  explaining what each of the letters in the initialism mean. Made in
  collaboration with volunteers from 'Maribro Skozi Rožnata očala', which is the
  only programme in the city of Maribor aimed at LGBTQIA+ Youth, promoting
  inclusivity, visibility and diversity. Design and editorial made by me.
